# Customer-Churn-ML-Model

This repository consists of a machine learning project done during my time as an MSBA candidate at UC Irvine. We take a look at Customer Churn data provided by Telco and seek to predict churn outcomes of customers using a variety of Machine Learning models such as XGBoost and Random Forest.
